# Sifat Portfolio (scaffold)

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold for a portfolio built to the spec you provided.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev
```

What's included:
- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS + PostCSS
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- react-intersection-observer (recommended for on-scroll reveals)
